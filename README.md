## section 1: getting started
* this was mostly just setup
* containers
    * a unit of software -- code and the dependencies to run it
    * same container will always give you same behavior and result
    * docker simplifies creation and mgmt
* why containers?
    * build/test in exactly the same env as production
    * clone versions of dependencies across envs
* VMs versus Containers
    * VM = like a container, but more complex (virtual OS) and more overhead
    * VM competes with the base OS for resources, poor performance
    * 



## section 2: images and containers
* core concepts are containers and images
* using pre-built/custom images
* creating and managing containers
